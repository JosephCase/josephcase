			<h3>A single page application, artist portfolio website with a custom made CMS.</h3>
			<p>A project I solely developed, it consists of 3 applications hosted on an AWS EC2 instance; a Node REST API which acts as the data layer over a mySQL database and writes and serves image/video content, a Node CMS which allows the user to create and edit pages, text, image and video content, and a React/Redux/React Router single page application website (<a href="http://www.giusypirrotta.com" target='_blank'>www.giusypirrotta.com</a>).</p>
			

			<h4>Key feature - Image optimisation</h4>

			<p>It was important that the website could display high quality images at multiple sizes and across multiple devices, whilst keeping download times to a minimum. In order to achieve this images uploaded to the CMS are piped to the API where they are written to disc at various dimensions using an npm ImageMagick wrapper. The website itself is then chooses the most appropriate image size to serve, based on the physical width of the image element on the page.</p>


			<h4>The website</h4>

			<p>I wanted to provide a slick user experience so developed the website as a single page application with no requests to the server when navigating between pages. In order to achieve this the website routinely requests all the data that it needs from the API and caches it on the server. Then when there is a request it creates a Redux store using the cached site data, renders the initial load on the server and sends it, along with the site data, to the client. On the client the store is then hydrated with the site data and on navigation, using React Router and the history object, events are dispatched to the store and a connected page component then renders the new page based on the existing data in the store, without the need to make further server requests.</p>


			<h4>The CMS &amp; API</h4>

			<p>The CMS essentially acts as a user interface for the API performing minimal backend logic. When editing a page the CMS gives the user a graphical representation of the changes due to take place and the user can then save those changes once they are happy. When a page is saved the multiple changes are PATCHED to the server as a JSON set of instruction objects, with and associated files uploaded using FormData object. These requests are then streamed over to the API.</p>

        	</video>
        	<span class='caption'>N.B.	-	video shows an outdated version of the website, but the idea is much the same.</span>
			<p>The API then asynchronously iterates over the JSON instruction objects, performing CRUD operations to the mySQL database and saving or deleting any associated image or video files.</p>

			<h3>A development tool that converts layered psds into both horizontally and vertically responsive cross device ad units.</h3>
			
			<p>Developed during my time at Bluequest, this ad building tool developed in PHP allows our developers to create and edit the layout of cross device, horizontally and vertically responsive advertising unit, by simply dragging and dropping psds or images onto a work area - greatly improving our productivity.</p>
			<p>Once the ad has been created the user can edit its layout using the AdBuilder's editing tools and then has the freedom to develop bespoke features, such as navigation, animations and canvas features using custom code.</p>

				<source src='video/adBuilder.webm' type='video/webm' />
				<source src='video/adBuilder.mp4' type='video/mp4' />
        	</video>

			<h4>Core concept</h4>
			<p>The ad is represented by a hierarchical PHP class structure Ad > View > Element. The application processes each layer of an uploaded psd, saving the image and storing it's size, position and reference to its image as an Element object. The Ad object then writes a HTML and CSS file representing the PSD in HTML form and saves the Ad object as JSON, so that it can be recalled and edited later.</p>

			<h4>Cross-device support</h4>
			<p>The AdBuilder supports multiple device designs within a single unit through use of the View class. PSDs can be uploaded for each 'view' (e.g. Desktop, Tablet and Mobile) and our independent Scale_Controller.js module controls which view to show and the corresponding images to load based on the browser window size.</p>

			<h4>Editing</h4>
			<p>The AdBuilder features a set of editing tools which enable the user to add content and edit the layout of an ad that it has created. It does this by re-instantiating the Ad object from it's saved JSON and then updating it based on the changes made, before rewriting the HTML, CSS and re-saving itself  as JSON.</p>
			<p>The editing tools allows the user to;</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Create new Elements by uploading images or psds.</li>
				<li>Change Element anchor positions.</li>
				<li>Control Element scale behaviour.</li>
				<li>Group/ungroup Elements (the PHP Element objects can be nested).</li>
				<li>Delete Elements.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>A responsive travel website with pre-compiled CMS data for faster load times.</h3>
			
			<p>During my time at Intuitive (<a href='http://www.intuitivesystems.com/' target='_blank'>www.intuitivesystems.com</a>) I took the lead in the development of a new client website for Classic Collection (<a href='http://www.classic-collection.co.uk' target='_blank'>www.classic-collection.co.uk</a>). The website reads for a SQL "Big C" data table which stores pre-processed CMS information as XML for fast read times. The website CMS offers the client a high level of customisability including the ability to override the natural data hierarchy.</p>

			<h4>Application Structure</h4>
			<p>The website structure is based on an XML map which defines page types and the 'widgets' that should appear on them. A 'widget' in this context is VB.Net class which performs some function on the page, usually displaying a section of content such as an image gallery or a Google maps feature.</p>
			<p>Generally speaking each widget will correspond to a row within the "Big C" data table, if it is page specific identified by the widget type, page type and page id. The "Big C" table contains pre-compiled XML representing the CMS data for the unique instance of a widget on a page. The widget class will pull the data from the "Big C" table and initially present it on page using XSLT. For widgets where not all the data is displayed immediately or were greater level of functionality is required (for example a results page with filters and pagination) the "Big C" XML is parsed and stored within the instance of the widget class, so that it can be manipulated and presented in response to later AJAX calls.</p>

			<h4>CMS Control</h4>
			<p>The CMS is built within the companies iVector CMS structure, where each page or section is represented by a CMS page and a corresponding CMS table. These can be bespoke CMS pages, or pages based on the existing data in the iVector core database, for example a CMS page which allows the client to customise Hotel pages. At a set interval a stored SQL script will pull the required information for each widget from CMS and core tables and write it as XML to the "Big C" data table.</p>
			<p>The CMS also gives the client the ability to override the data from the iVector core tables and change the natural hierarchy. The central content for the website is based on a Country > Region > Resort > Hotel hierarchy and the CMS gives the client the ability to show and hide Countries, Region, Resorts and Hotels, but also present Countries, Regions and Resorts interchangeably, for example changing a particular country (somewhere like Monaco) to a hierarchy of Country -> Hotel, so that while it will appear as a country, it will behave as a Resort (i.e. the parent of Hotels).</p>
