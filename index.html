		<h2>Key Challenge: Image optimisation</h2>
		<div class="demo"></div>
		<div class="text">
			<p>The main focus of this website was to display images demonstrating the artist&rsquo;s portfolio of work. It was important that these images were both good quality and also that they displayed correctly on viewports of different sizes.</p>

			<p>To ensure the all images were good quality on all devices and that page loads times were kept to a minimum I decided to optimise the images so that each would be available in 3 different sizes and then let the browser choose which source image to use, dependant on the display size.</p>

			<p>I decided rather than resizing each image manually using something Photoshop I would write a PHP script to do it for me, this would allow me to resize all images in one go, as well as any new images being added to the site. I wrote a php script (imageResizer.php), which loops recursively through the directory structure creating copies of the original images in 3 different sizes using the GD??. I then dynamically set a data-src tag which references each original image and then used Javascript (images.js) to loop through each image on the page, check it&rsquo;s width (applying a factor of 2 for those devices with a pixel ratio of greater than or equal to 2) and then choose an appropriately sized image as the src.</p>

			<p>The main issue I encountered whilst doing this was when downsizing an image by a factor of over 2, the resulting image would be noticeably more blurred than its original. After a bit of research and testing I found that I could greatly improve the appearance of the image produced by applying a convolution matrix in order to sharpen it, resulting in a resized image that was not noticeably different to it&rsquo;s original.</p>
