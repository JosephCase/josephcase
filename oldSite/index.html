		<h2>About this website</h2>
		<p>I created this site for potential employers to showcase my knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
		<p>Please take your time to visit each page using the navigation bar at the top of the page, each page will demonstrate my knowledge and ideas in that area.</p>
		<p>The site has been created using Notepad++ using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The emphasis is on the functionality of the webpages rather than the content. Please view the source as I have annotated this to provide additional information.</p>
		<p>To build the site I used knowledge gained from studying <cite>HTML & CSS - Design and Build Websites</cite> by John Duckett, which I read prior and information from <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">www.w3schools.com</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">stackoverflow.com</a> which I used more as quick and useful references as I worked.</p>
		<!-- I have used target="_blank" to open these webpages in new tabs-->
		<p>The site is still a work in progress and I will be updating, improving and adding information regularly. Currently I am looking to improve the <a href="#" onclick="pull3()">Images</a> page and add a page on Forms.</p>
		<p>I hope you enjoy the website. I would very much appreciate any feedback so please <a href="mailto:joseph.case@hotmail.co.uk">email me</a> if you have any comments.</p>

		<h2>About me</h2>
		<p>I am a graduate in Civil Engineering from the University of Manchester, currently working customer services in a busy office handling magazine subscriptions.</p>
		<p>I've always had an interest in computer programming having first encountered it in my teens. Whilst at school I began creating Flash games using ActionScript programming, teaching myself through trial and error and what I could find on the internet. In 2005 one of the first <a href="JavaScript:newPopup('http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/234875/display/popup/sid/51b4b16b49f26');">Flash games</a> I made was published on the NewGrounds website and can be found <a href="JavaScript:newPopup('http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/234875/display/popup/sid/51b4b16b49f26');">here</a>. (This will open a new tab. Please note the game does have sound and music, so you may want to adjust your speaker volume.)</p>
		<p>After graduating in 2011 I worked for a year living at home and saving to go travelling. At the end of September 2012 I travelled through Europe and eventually Morocco.</p>
		<p>On my return, based on my enjoyment of developing Flash games, I decided to look into a career in Web Development and bought <cite>HTML & CSS - Design and Build Websites</cite> by John Duckett. I have very much enjoyed working through this and feel it has given me a solid understanding of HTML5 and CSS3.</p>
		<p>I am now very keen to put what I have learnt into practice and expand upon it in a professional environment.</p>

		<h2>Positioning</h2>
		<p>I have used the CSS3 <i>position</i> property in different ways.</p>
		<p>The main navigation bar has been given a <i>position</i> value of <i>fixed</i>, so that it is fixed in the same position on the screen, even when scrolling.</p>
		<p>It's been given a <i>width</i> value of 100% so that it spans the width of the screen for all resolutions.</p>
		<p>The pages themselves have been given a <i>position</i> value of <i>absolute</i> (this is later manipulated using JavaScript).</p>
		<p>To make the content sit centrally on screens of all resolutions I have; given them a fixed <i>width</i> of 960px, set their <i>left</i> positioning value to 50% and then given them a <i>margin-left</i> value of -480px (half page width).</p>
		</article>
		<article class="w300">
		<h2>:hover</h2>
		<p>The CCS3 pseudo class property <i>:hover</i> is extremely useful for adding interactivity to webpages simply, without the need for JavaScript.</p>
		<p>The navigation bar above demonstrates its usefulness for creating drop down boxes.</p>
		<p>Notice each header's drop down menu is revealed in a different style, the latter two using the CCS3 <i>transition</i> property.</p>
		
		</article>
		<article class="w300">
		<h2>Shadows</h2>
		<p>I've also taken advantage of the CSS3 <i>box-shadow</i> property to give subtle shadows to some elements to give a more 3-dimensional-layered feel to the page.</p>
		</article>
		
		<article class="w300">
		<h2>Opacity</h2>
		<p>You will notice each drop down menu has slight transparency created using the CSS3 <i>opacity</i> property.</p>
		</article>
		
		<article class="w300 right"> <!-- class right floats element to the right -->
		<h2>Rounded Corners</h2>
		<p>The drop down menu's have also had their bottom corners rounded using the CSS3 <i>border-radius</i> property.</p>
